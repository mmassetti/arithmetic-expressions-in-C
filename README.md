# arithmetic-expressions-in-C
Program in C language that allows the user to evaluate arithmetic expressions given in PRE-ORDER. Project made for the subject "Organizacion de Computadoras", for the career "Ingenieria en Sistemas de Software" at Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina.

To achieve this we implemented the following:

-A List ADT (Abstract Data Type), using dynamic memory with the library functions malloc and free
-A Stack ADT, to storage strings 
-A program that evaluates arithmetic expressions in pre-order, on the standar input and with the help of the two ADT above
